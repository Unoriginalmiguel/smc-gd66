                <h1>Masking the Vulnerable</h1>
                <h4>June 1, 2020 â€“ Karyl Anne Fischero</h4>
                <p>If there is anything positive to come from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is the way groups of people have stepped up to help those in need. Often, these groups spring from concerned and committed citizens, not professional organizations. One such community is a sewing guild in Alberta, Canada. Random Acts Regional Representative Kristen Desjarlais-deKlerk stepped in to donate funds for materials the guild turned into masks for locals in need.</p>
                <h3>Tucking Away Quilts for Masks</h3>
                <p>The sewing guild, led by Melanie David, originally formed as a group of quilters. However, with the pandemic, they tucked away their quilts and turned their attention to making fabric masks to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Masks are in high demand, and many of those in need of masks may not have sewing machines or cannot find fabric to make their own. That is where community mask-makers come in. Most mask-makers have been donating their wares to first responders and essential workers, and the sewing guild is no exception. After donating masks to homeless shelters, however, the sewing guild saw an additional need: children. The group put out a call to single mothers, knowing that their children will most likely have to accompany the parents on essential errands. The guild is offering to make masks for the mothers and their children to make errands as safe as possible.</p>
