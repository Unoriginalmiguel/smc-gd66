                Brothers Jake and Jamin Orrall are the sons of successful producer/singer/songwriter Robert Ellis Orrall and grew up surrounded by music. They founded JEFF the Brotherhood (originally simply called JEFF) in 2001, while still in high school. Their first album, I Like You, was funded using pre-orders from the audience at a show for their side project, The Sex. Although this work did not see widespread exposure, it received critical acclaim. They started several other bands and side projects (including post-punk quartet Be Your Own Pet), eventually leaving them all and moving from Nashville to Chicago in order to pursue JEFF the Brotherhood full-time. The band returned to Nashville when Jamin dropped out of Columbia College Chicago.
